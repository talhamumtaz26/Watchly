    watched/
      movie_789: {...}

## üîÑ Migration Path

If you have existing localStorage data, it can be migrated:

```javascript
import { syncLocalToCloud } from "./utils/cloudStorage";
import { exportData } from "./utils/storage";

// Get local data
const localData = exportData();

// Sync to cloud (when user logs in)
await syncLocalToCloud(userId, localData);
```

## üìù Important Notes

1. **Firebase Free Tier Limits:**

   - 50,000 reads/day
   - 20,000 writes/day
   - 20,000 deletes/day
   - 1GB storage
   - (Should be plenty for personal use)

2. **Security:**

   - Never commit `.env` file
   - Update Firestore rules before production
   - Use Firebase App Check for extra security

3. **Performance:**

   - Firestore is fast (< 100ms reads)
   - Data cached locally by Firebase SDK
   - Offline support available

4. **Costs:**
   - Free tier is generous
   - Set up billing alerts
   - Monitor usage in Firebase Console
