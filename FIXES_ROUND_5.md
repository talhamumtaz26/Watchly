# UI Fixes & Improvements - Round 5

## All Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. ‚úÖ MovieCard Hover Overlay - Made Transparent

**Issue**: Purple gradient overlay was too strong on hover, hiding the movie poster.

**Solution**:

- Removed `bg-gradient-purple bg-opacity-0 group-hover:bg-opacity-20`
- Changed to `bg-transparent` - completely transparent background
- Now only the "View Details" button appears on hover
- Poster remains fully visible with just a subtle darkening from the existing gradient

**File Modified**: `src/components/MovieCard.jsx`

**Before**: Purple tint covered the entire card on hover
**After**: Transparent overlay, only button visible

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Movie Title Alignment Fixed

**Issue**: Movie titles had inconsistent heights - some 1 line, some 2 lines causing misalignment.

**Solution**:

- Reduced font size from `text-base` to `text-sm`
- Added `min-h-[2.5rem]` to ensure all titles take same vertical space
- Kept `line-clamp-2` to allow 2 lines maximum
- Now all cards have consistent height regardless of title length

**File Modified**: `src/components/MovieCard.jsx`

**CSS Changes**:

```jsx
// Before
className =
  "font-display font-semibold text-base text-white line-clamp-2 mb-1 text-shadow-lg";

// After
className =
  "font-display font-semibold text-sm text-white line-clamp-2 mb-1 text-shadow-lg min-h-[2.5rem]";
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Details Page Backdrop Height Reduced

**Issue**: Backdrop was taking too much space (70vh), pushing content too far down.

**Solution**:

- Reduced height from `h-[70vh]` to `h-[50vh]`
- Reduced padding from `p-8` to `p-6`
- Reduced poster size from `w-48 md:w-64` to `w-40 md:w-56`
- Reduced title size from `text-4xl md:text-6xl` to `text-3xl md:text-5xl`
- Reduced metadata text from `text-lg` to `text-base`
- Content now starts higher up the page

**File Modified**: `src/pages/Details.jsx`

**Changes**:

- **Height**: 70vh ‚Üí 50vh (20vh less space)
- **Poster**: Smaller and more compact
- **Title**: Slightly smaller but still prominent
- **Spacing**: Tighter overall layout

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Cast Member Images Restored

**Issue**: Cast member profile images were not showing - `src` attribute was missing.

**Solution**:

- Added back the complete `<img>` tag with all attributes:
  - `src={getImageUrl(actor.profile_path, 'w185')}`
  - `alt={actor.name}`
  - `className` with rounded corners and hover effect
- Images now display properly with fallback placeholder

**File Modified**: `src/pages/Details.jsx`

**Fixed Code**:

```jsx
<img
  src={getImageUrl(actor.profile_path, "w185")}
  alt={actor.name}
  className="w-full aspect-square object-cover rounded-2xl mb-3 group-hover:scale-105 transition-transform shadow-card"
  onError={(e) => {
    e.target.src =
      "https://via.placeholder.com/185x278/1E293B/94A3B8?text=No+Image";
  }}
/>
```

### 5. ‚úÖ Watch Later Estimated Time Fixed

**Issue**: Estimated time was showing 0 or incorrect values.

**Root Cause**:

- Runtime data wasn't always present in stored items
- TV shows need different calculation (episodes √ó runtime)

**Solution**:

- Improved calculation logic:
  - **Movies**: Use `runtime` or default to 120 minutes (2 hours)
  - **TV Shows**: Calculate `episode_run_time √ó number_of_episodes` (default 45 min/ep, 10 episodes)
- Better display: Shows `<1h` if under 1 hour
- More accurate estimates for both media types

**File Modified**: `src/pages/WatchLater.jsx`

**New Calculation**:

```jsx
{
  (() => {
    const totalMinutes = items.reduce((total, item) => {
      if (item.media_type === "movie") {
        return total + (item.runtime || 120); // Default 2 hours
      } else {
        const episodeTime = item.episode_run_time || 45;
        const episodes = item.number_of_episodes || 10;
        return total + episodeTime * episodes;
      }
    }, 0);
    const hours = Math.round(totalMinutes / 60);
    return hours > 0 ? `${hours}h` : "<1h";
  })();
}
```

**Bonus**: Also updated the styling with gradient colors and better layout!

  {/* Decorative blurred circles */}

  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-6">
    <div className="bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-custom rounded-xl p-6 text-center border border-white/20 hover:scale-105">
      <div className="text-5xl font-bold text-white">{stats}</div>
      <div className="text-sm text-white/90">Label</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  {/* Summary card at bottom */}
</div>
```
