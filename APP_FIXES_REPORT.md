## Date: October 18, 2025

---

## 🎯 Primary Issues Fixed

### 1. **White Screen During Navigation** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** When navigating between pages, users experienced a white flash/screen before content loaded, creating a jarring experience.

**Solution Implemented:**

- Created `LoadingSpinner.jsx` component with black background and animated logo
- Implemented React.lazy() for code-splitting all route components
- Added React Suspense with LoadingSpinner as fallback
- Loading screens now show:
  - Animated Watchly logo (pulsing)
  - Red spinning loader
  - Contextual loading messages ("Loading details...", "Loading upcoming releases...", etc.)

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/LoadingSpinner.jsx` (NEW)
- `src/App.js` - Added lazy imports and Suspense wrapper
- `src/pages/Details.jsx` - Replaced inline spinner with LoadingSpinner
- `src/pages/Actor.jsx` - Replaced inline spinner with LoadingSpinner
- `src/pages/Genre.jsx` - Replaced inline spinner with LoadingSpinner
- `src/pages/Upcoming.jsx` - Replaced inline spinner with LoadingSpinner

### 2. **Scroll Position Not Resetting** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** When navigating to a new page, the scroll position from the previous page persisted.

**Solution Implemented:**

- Created `ScrollToTop.jsx` component
- Automatically scrolls to top (instant, no animation) on route change
- Removed redundant scroll-to-top code from MovieCard component

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/ScrollToTop.jsx` (NEW)
- `src/App.js` - Added ScrollToTop component inside Router
- `src/components/MovieCard.jsx` - Removed onClick scroll handler (now redundant)

---

### 3. **Empty State Scrolling Issues** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Empty states in Watched, Watch Later, and Search pages were not properly centered and still allowed scrolling.

**Solution Implemented:**

- Added `overflow-hidden` to parent containers when empty
- Used exact `h-screen` height for proper centering
- Applied `flex items-center justify-center` for vertical/horizontal centering
- Only enable scrolling (`overflow-y-auto`) when content exists

**Files Modified:**

- `src/pages/Watched.jsx`
- `src/pages/WatchLater.jsx`
- `src/pages/Search.jsx`

## 🔧 Technical Details

### React.lazy() Implementation

```javascript
const Home = lazy(() => import("./pages/Home"));

  window.scrollTo({ top: 0, left: 0, behavior: "instant" });
}, [pathname]);
```
