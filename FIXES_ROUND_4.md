# Round 4 Final Adjustments - Watchly App

This document summarizes the final polish adjustments made to the Watchly application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Button Position Swap ‚úÖ

**Issue**: View Episodes button was on the left side, needed to be on the right side with Mark Watched on the left.

**Solution**:

- Changed button order in season cards (Details.jsx)
- Mark Watched button now appears on the LEFT (green button)
- View Episodes button now appears on the RIGHT (text link with arrow)
- Changed flex layout from `justify-end` to `justify-between` for proper spacing

**Files Modified**:

- `src/pages/Details.jsx` (lines 427-442)

**Code Changes**:

```jsx
// Before: Both buttons on right with justify-end
<div className="flex gap-2 justify-end items-center">
  <button onClick={loadSeasonDetails}>View Episodes ‚Üí</button>
  <button onClick={handleMarkSeasonWatched}>‚úì Mark Watched</button>
</div>

// After: Mark Watched left, View Episodes right with justify-between
<div className="flex gap-2 justify-between items-center">
  <button onClick={handleMarkSeasonWatched}>‚úì Mark Watched</button>
  <button onClick={loadSeasonDetails}>View Episodes ‚Üí</button>
</div>
```

### 2. Track Episodes Button Restoration ‚úÖ

**Issue**: Track Episodes button was removed in Round 3 when episodes were set to always show. User wanted the button back for easy navigation.

**Solution**:

- Restored the Track Episodes button between "Already Watched" badge and Overview section
- Button uses existing `handleTrackEpisodesClick` function which scrolls to episodes section
- Episodes remain visible by default (`showEpisodes: true`)
- Button provides quick navigation to episodes even when they're already visible

**Files Modified**:

- `src/pages/Details.jsx` (lines 360-385)

**Code Changes**:

```jsx
// Added back between "Already Watched" and Overview
{
  watchedItem && (
    <span className="inline-block bg-green-600/20 text-green-400 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm">
      ‚úì Already Watched
    </span>
  );
}
<button
  onClick={handleTrackEpisodesClick}
  className="inline-block bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700 text-white px-6 py-2 rounded-lg transition-all"
>
  üì∫ Track Episodes
</button>;
```

**Button Functionality**:

- Purple button with üì∫ emoji icon
- Smooth scroll to episodes section using `episodesRef.current?.scrollIntoView()`
- Visible for all TV shows regardless of episode visibility

### 3. Icon Consistency Verification ‚úÖ

**Issue**: User mentioned wanting to use FiSun and FiMoon icons consistently across the app.

**Solution**:

- Verified all theme toggle icons already use `FiSun` and `FiMoon` from `react-icons/fi`
- Confirmed no emoji icons (‚òÄÔ∏èüåô) exist in the codebase
- Icons are consistently styled with proper colors:
  - **Dark Mode**: Yellow sun icon (`text-yellow-400`)
  - **Light Mode**: Blue moon icon (`text-blue-600`)

**Files Verified**:

- `src/components/ThemeToggle.jsx` - Navbar theme toggle
- `src/pages/Settings.jsx` - Settings page theme toggle

**Icon Usage**:

```jsx
// ThemeToggle.jsx - Navbar
{theme === 'dark' ? (
  <FiSun className="text-yellow-400" size={22} />
) : (
  <FiMoon className="text-blue-600" size={22} />
)}

// Settings.jsx - Toggle switch
<FiSun className="text-yellow-400" size={20} />
<FiMoon className="text-blue-600" size={20} />
```

**Verification Method**:

- Grep search for emoji icons: `No matches found`
- Grep search for FiSun/FiMoon: 16 matches (all in ThemeToggle and Settings)
- All theme icons already updated in Round 3
