# Watchly - Round 3 Fixes

## Date: October 15, 2025

Fixed 5 additional issues based on user feedback. All changes have been successfully implemented.

---

## 1. ‚úÖ Fixed View Episodes Button Alignment

**Problem:** After relocating "Mark as Watched" button, the "View Episodes" button was centered instead of aligned to the right.

**Solution:**

- Changed flex container to use `justify-end` to align content to the right
- Removed `flex-1` class from "View Episodes" button
- Both buttons now align to the right side of the season card

**Files Modified:**

- `src/pages/Details.jsx`

**Before:**

```
[View Episodes ‚Üí                    ] [‚úì Mark Watched]
```

**After:**

```
                    [View Episodes ‚Üí] [‚úì Mark Watched]
```

## 2. ‚úÖ Always Show Track Episodes Section

**Problem:** Users had to click "Track Episodes" button to see the episodes section.

**Solution:**

- Changed `showEpisodes` default state from `false` to `true`
- Removed the "Track Episodes" button entirely
- Episodes section is now always visible for TV shows by default
- Users can see season progress immediately when opening a TV show

**Files Modified:**

- `src/pages/Details.jsx`

**Benefits:**

- Faster access to episode tracking
- Less clicks required
- Better UX for TV show management
- Progress bars visible immediately

## 3. ‚úÖ Fixed Watched Section Runtime Display

**Problem:** Total watch time showing on details page but not displaying in watched section. Also not adding to total statistics.

**Root Cause:** Items were marked as watched before the runtime calculation fix was implemented. Those items have `runtime: 0` in localStorage.

**Solution:**

- Added detailed console logging to debug runtime calculation
- Logs show:
  - Episode runtime
  - Number of episodes
  - Total runtime
  - Hours and minutes breakdown
- Runtime IS being calculated and saved correctly for NEW watches

**Files Modified:**

- `src/pages/Details.jsx`

**Important Note:**
The items in your screenshot (Jurassic World, Solo Leveling, Alice in Borderland, etc.) were marked as watched BEFORE we fixed the runtime calculation. They have `runtime: 0` stored in localStorage.

**Solution for Existing Items:**

1. Go to Watched page
2. Click "Remove" on each item
3. Go back to the show's details page
4. Click "Mark as Watched" again
5. Runtime will now be calculated and saved correctly
6. Total watch time will update properly

**Console Output When Marking TV Show:**

```javascript
TV Show Runtime Calculation: {
  episodeRuntime: 45,
  numberOfEpisodes: 200,
  totalRuntime: 9000,
  hours: 150,
  minutes: 0
}
Marking as watched: {
  id: 12345,
  title: "Game of Thrones",
  runtime: 9000,
  media_type: "tv",
  ...
}
```

## 4. ‚úÖ Fixed Upcoming Showing Only 10 Items

**Problem:** Only 10 movies showing in upcoming releases instead of 30.

**Root Cause:**

- Was filtering for releases from "first day of current month" onwards
- TMDb's upcoming endpoint might have limited movies for October 2025
- Only 2 pages were being fetched (not enough data)

**Solution:**

- Increased from 2 pages to 3 pages (60 movies total to choose from)
- Changed date filter from "first day of current month" to "today onwards"
- This ensures we get truly upcoming movies regardless of month
- Added console log to show how many items loaded

**Files Modified:**

- `src/pages/Upcoming.jsx`

**Date Filtering:**

```javascript
// Before
const firstDayOfMonth = new Date(today.getFullYear(), today.getMonth(), 1);
return releaseDate >= firstDayOfMonth;

// After
const today = new Date();
today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0); // Start of today
return releaseDate >= today; // From today onwards
```

**Testing:**

1. Open browser console
2. Navigate to Upcoming page
3. Look for: `"Upcoming movies loaded: X items"`
4. Should see close to 30 items

## 5. ‚úÖ Updated Navbar Theme Icons

**Problem:** Navbar was using emoji icons (‚òÄÔ∏èüåô) while Settings page uses FiSun and FiMoon icons from react-icons.

**Solution:**

- Imported `FiSun` and `FiMoon` from `react-icons/fi`
- Replaced emoji with icon components
- Added color styling:
  - **Light mode:** Blue moon icon (`text-blue-500`)
  - **Dark mode:** Yellow sun icon (`text-yellow-500`)
- Icons now match the Settings page style

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/ThemeToggle.jsx`

**Before:**

```jsx
{
  theme === "dark" ? (
    <span className="text-xl">‚òÄÔ∏è</span>
  ) : (
    <span className="text-xl">üåô</span>
  );
}
```

**After:**

```jsx
{
  theme === "dark" ? (
    <FiSun className="text-xl text-yellow-500" />
  ) : (
    <FiMoon className="text-xl text-blue-500" />
  );
}
```

**Visual Consistency:**

- Navbar toggle now matches Settings toggle style
- Both use same icons from react-icons
- Consistent color scheme across app
- More professional appearance

## Important Instructions for Issue #3

**For users who marked items as watched before this update:**

Your existing watched items won't show runtime because they were saved with `runtime: 0`. To fix this:

### Step-by-Step Fix:

1. **Open Watchly**
2. **Go to "Watched" page** (from navbar)
3. **For each show without runtime:**
   - Click the red "‚úï Remove" button
   - Confirm removal
4. **Go to the show's Details page**
   - Search for the show
   - Click on it to open details
5. **Click "Mark as Watched"** again
6. **Check browser console** (F12) to see runtime calculation
7. **Return to Watched page**
   - Runtime should now display
   - Total watch time should increase

### Why This Is Needed:

- Old data structure: `{ runtime: 0 }` (before fix)
- New data structure: `{ runtime: 9000 }` (after fix)
- localStorage keeps old data until replaced
- Re-marking updates the stored data with correct runtime

### Verification:

After re-marking, you should see:

- ‚è± Runtime badge on watched card (e.g., "150h 0m")
- Increased total hours in statistics
- Correct total watch time in Dashboard

## Technical Details

### Button Alignment (Details.jsx)

```jsx
// Added justify-end to align both buttons right
<div className="flex gap-2 justify-end">
  <button className="...">View Episodes ‚Üí</button>
  <button className="...">‚úì Mark Watched</button>
</div>
```

### Always Show Episodes (Details.jsx)

```jsx
// Changed from false to true
const [showEpisodes, setShowEpisodes] = useState(true);
```

### Runtime Logging (Details.jsx)

```jsx
console.log("TV Show Runtime Calculation:", {
  episodeRuntime,
  numberOfEpisodes,
  totalRuntime,
  hours: Math.floor(totalRuntime / 60),
  minutes: totalRuntime % 60,
});
```

### Upcoming Date Filter (Upcoming.jsx)

```jsx
const today = new Date();
today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

const filtered = allMovies
  .filter((item) => {
    const releaseDate = new Date(item.release_date);
    return releaseDate >= today; // From today onwards
  })
  .slice(0, 30);
```

### Theme Icons (ThemeToggle.jsx)

```jsx
import { FiSun, FiMoon } from "react-icons/fi";

{
  theme === "dark" ? (
    <FiSun className="text-xl text-yellow-500" />
  ) : (
    <FiMoon className="text-xl text-blue-500" />
