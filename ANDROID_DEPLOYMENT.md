# 📱 Android Deployment Guide - PWA (Progressive Web App)

## 🎉 Your Watchly App Now Works on Android!

Your app is now a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that can be installed on Android devices just like a native app!

## ✅ What's Been Done

- ✅ PWA enabled with service worker
- ✅ Manifest configured for Android
- ✅ App icons created (192x192 and 512x512)
- ✅ Offline support enabled
- ✅ Theme colors set (purple gradient)
- ✅ Standalone mode (looks like native app)

## 🚀 How to Install on Android

### Method 1: Install from Chrome (Recommended)

1. **Open Chrome on your Android device**

2. **Visit your deployed app URL** (after deployment):

   ```
   https://your-app-url.com
   ```

3. **Look for the install prompt**:

   - Chrome will show "Add Watchly to Home screen"
   - Or tap the ⋮ menu → "Install app" or "Add to Home screen"

4. **Tap "Install"**

5. **Done!** The app icon appears on your home screen

### Method 2: Testing on Local Network

1. **Get your computer's IP address** (already got it: `192.168.100.45`)

2. **Make sure your phone is on the SAME Wi-Fi** as your computer

3. **Open Chrome on Android** and visit:

   ```
   http://192.168.100.45:3000
   ```

4. **Install** using Chrome menu → "Add to Home screen"

## 📦 Building for Production

Before deploying to Android users, build the production version:

### Step 1: Build Production Files

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates optimized files in the `build/` folder.

### Step 2: Test Production Build Locally

```bash
# Install serve if you don't have it
npm install -g serve

# Serve the production build
serve -s build -l 3000
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Hosting

Choose one of these options:

#### Option A: Firebase Hosting (Recommended - Already using Firebase!)

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize hosting
firebase init hosting

# Select options:
# - Use existing project (select your Watchly project)
# - Public directory: build
# - Single-page app: Yes
# - Automatic builds: No (or Yes if you want)

# Deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

Your app will be at: `https://your-project.firebaseapp.com`

#### Option B: Vercel (Super Easy)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow prompts, done!
```

#### Option C: Netlify

1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Drag and drop your `build` folder
3. Done!

## 🔥 Firebase Configuration for Android

**Good news!** Your existing Firebase **WEB** configuration works perfectly on Android PWA!

### In Firebase Console:

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your Watchly project
3. Go to Project Settings
4. Under "Your apps", you should see your Web app
5. **No need to add Android app!** The web config works for PWA

### Authorized Domains:

After deployment, add your domain to Firebase:

1. Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings
2. "Authorized domains" section
3. Click "Add domain"
4. Add your deployed URL (e.g., `your-app.firebaseapp.com`)

## 📱 PWA Features on Android

### What Works:

- ✅ **Install to home screen** - Just like a native app
- ✅ **Standalone mode** - No browser UI
- ✅ **Offline support** - Works without internet (cached content)
- ✅ **Push notifications** (can be added later)
- ✅ **Camera access** (if needed)
- ✅ **Location access** (if needed)
- ✅ **Add to home screen prompt**
- ✅ **Splash screen** (uses your theme colors)
- ✅ **Portrait orientation** (locked)

### How It Looks:

When installed on Android:

- 📱 App icon on home screen (with your purple gradient icon)
- 🎨 Purple theme color in status bar
- 🖼️ No browser controls (looks like native app)
- ⚡ Fast loading (cached)
- 🔄 Works offline (shows cached content)

## 🎨 Customization

### Change App Icon

Replace these files in `public/` folder:

- `logo192.png` - 192x192 icon
- `logo512.png` - 512x512 icon

Use a tool like:

- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator

### Change Theme Colors

Edit `public/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "theme_color": "#A855F7", // Status bar color (purple)
  "background_color": "#0B1120" // Splash screen background (dark blue)
}
```

### Change App Name

Edit `public/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "short_name": "Watchly", // Shows under icon (max 12 chars)
  "name": "Watchly - Movie & TV Tracker" // Full name in store
}
```

## 🔒 HTTPS Requirement

**Important:** PWAs ONLY work with HTTPS (secure connection).

- ✅ localhost works without HTTPS (for testing)
- ✅ Firebase Hosting automatically provides HTTPS
- ✅ Vercel/Netlify automatically provide HTTPS
- ❌ HTTP won't work in production

## 📊 Testing Checklist

Before deploying:

### On Desktop:

- [ ] Run `npm run build` successfully
- [ ] Test production build with `serve -s build`
- [ ] Check manifest in Chrome DevTools (F12 → Application → Manifest)
- [ ] Verify service worker registers (Application → Service Workers)

### On Android:

- [ ] Visit app URL in Chrome
- [ ] See "Add to Home screen" prompt
- [ ] Install app to home screen
- [ ] Open installed app (should open in standalone mode)
- [ ] Test login/signup
- [ ] Test adding to Watch Later
- [ ] Test marking as Watched
- [ ] Turn off Wi-Fi, test offline mode
- [ ] Check theme color shows in status bar

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Add to Home screen" not showing

**Solution:**

- Make sure you're on HTTPS (or localhost for testing)
- Check manifest is valid (Chrome DevTools → Application → Manifest)
- Refresh page and wait a few seconds
- Manually add: Chrome menu → "Add to Home screen"

### Service worker not registering

**Solution:**

- Clear cache and reload
- Check console for errors
- Make sure you ran `npm run build` before deploying
- Service workers only work on HTTPS (or localhost)

### Firebase auth not working on Android

**Solution:**

- Add your deployed domain to Firebase authorized domains
- Make sure you're using HTTPS
- Check Firebase config is correct in `.env`

### App opens in browser instead of standalone

**Solution:**

- Uninstall and reinstall the app
- Check `manifest.json` has `"display": "standalone"`
- Clear browser data and try again

## 🚀 Deployment Steps Summary

1. **Build production version:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Firebase Hosting:**

   ```bash
   firebase init hosting
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

3. **Get your app URL:**

   ```
   https://your-project.firebaseapp.com
   ```

4. **Add domain to Firebase Authentication:**

   - Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains

5. **Test on Android:**
   - Open Chrome on Android
   - Visit your app URL
   - Install to home screen
   - Test all features

## 📱 Alternative: Native Android App (Future)

If you want a **true native app** for Google Play Store:

### Option 1: Capacitor (Easiest)

Wrap your React app in a native container:

```bash
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npx cap init
npx cap add android
npx cap sync
npx cap open android
```

Then build in Android Studio and publish to Play Store.

### Option 2: React Native (Full Rewrite)

Build a native app from scratch using React Native. Requires rewriting components.

### Option 3: PWA to Play Store

Use **Bubblewrap** or **PWABuilder** to package your PWA as an Android app:

```bash
npx @bubblewrap/cli init --manifest https://your-app.com/manifest.json
npx @bubblewrap/cli build
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Test locally first** using your phone on the same Wi-Fi
2. **Use Firebase Hosting** for easy deployment
3. **Add to home screen** to test PWA features
