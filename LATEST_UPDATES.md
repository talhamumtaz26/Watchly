## Next Steps for Premium Icons

Currently using emoji icons (üé¨, üì∫, ‚≠ê, etc.). For premium look, consider:

1. **React Icons Library** (Free)

   - Install: `npm install react-icons`
   - Provides: Font Awesome, Material Icons, Heroicons, etc.
   - Usage: `import { FaFilm, FaTv } from 'react-icons/fa'`

2. **Heroicons** (Free, by Tailwind)

   - Install: `npm install @heroicons/react`
   - Modern, clean SVG icons
   - Perfect match for Tailwind CSS

3. **Custom SVG Icons**
   - Upload your premium icon pack
   - Add to `src/assets/icons/` directory
   - Import and use as React components

Would you like me to:

- Install and integrate React Icons library?
- Replace emoji icons with professional SVG icons?
- Or wait for you to provide custom premium icons?
