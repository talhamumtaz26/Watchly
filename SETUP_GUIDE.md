# üöÄ Watchly - Complete Setup Guide

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get Watchly up and running:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal in the project directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages:

- react & react-dom
- react-router-dom (for routing)
- axios (for API calls)
- tailwindcss (for styling)
- And other development dependencies

### Step 2: Get Your TMDb API Key

1. Go to [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
2. Sign up for a free account (if you don't have one)
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí API ‚Üí Request an API Key
4. Fill out the form and get your API key

### Step 3: Configure API Key

1. Open the `.env` file in the project root directory
2. Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual TMDb API key:

```env
REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
REACT_APP_TMDB_BASE_URL=https://api.themoviedb.org/3
REACT_APP_TMDB_IMAGE_BASE_URL=https://image.tmdb.org/t/p
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Never commit your `.env` file with the real API key to version control!

### Step 4: Start the App

```bash
npm start
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`
